# Copilot Studio generative AI workshop

This repository contains a workshop for Copilot Studio, focusing on the generative AI capabilities of the product. It will not cover all topics related to Copilot Studio by any means, but it meant to give you a good understanding of the power and possibilities of the generative AI functionalities in Copilot Studio. 

The exercises will build up gradually, starting with a relatively simple agent, building up to a sophisticated autonomous agent. Therefore, it is advisable to start the labs from the beginning and not skip any exercises. 

The sample use-case is based on the public repository called [Contoso Chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat). This is a "pro-code" implementation/sample of a customer agent. The aim of this workshop is to show how a low-code tool like Copilot Studio can be used to achieve similar funcionality.

## Exercise structure

All the exercises can be found in the exercises folder. It is advisable to clone or download this repository, as it also contains a few files that will be used to provide the agent with knowledge.
